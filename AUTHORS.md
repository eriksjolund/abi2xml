Many thanks to Martti Tammi and Erik Arner who gave me expert advice concerning
the ABIF format.

Many thanks to Clark Tibbetts for describing the ABIF format in his publication 
(see README file).

Erik Arner also provided valuable feedback and ideas about "polishing" the end
product. Some new command line flags arose that way.
