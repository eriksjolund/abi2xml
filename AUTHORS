Many thanks to Martti Tammi and Erik Arner who gave me expert advice concerning
the Abi format.

Many thanks to Clark Tibbetts for describing the ABI format in his publication 
( see README file )

Erik Arner also provided valuable feedback and ideas about "polishing" the end
product. Some new command line flags arose that way.
