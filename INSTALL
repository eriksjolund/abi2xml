Prerequisites: You must have the qt library ( version >= 4.1 ) installed ( see http://www.trolltech.com )
               
For instance Fedora Core 4 is a Linux distribution where abi2xml is known to build. But first you need to download, build 
and install Qt-4.1 first, as it is not included in Fedora Core 4.

abi2xml is also known to build on Windows with Qt-4.1. The qt library is also available on MacOS, so abi2xml should probably work there too although
this has not yet been tested.

To install this program on a Unix platform ( e.g. Linux ), follow these steps:

1. qmake
2. make
3. make install

You should then find the executable in the bin subdirectory.
